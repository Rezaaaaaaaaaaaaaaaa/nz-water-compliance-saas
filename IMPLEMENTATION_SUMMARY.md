## üö® Critical Manual Tasks Required

### 1. Download Regulatory Documents (URGENT)
You need to manually download these documents to validate our implementation:

**Priority 1 (Must Have):**
- [ ] DWSP Template - Small Supplies (26-100 people)
- [ ] DWSP Template - Medium Supplies (101-500 people)
- [ ] Annual Compliance Report Template
- [ ] DWQAR Reporting Guidelines
- [ ] Drinking Water Quality Guidelines PDF
- [ ] Water Services Act 2021 full text

**Instructions:** See `/docs/regulations/DOCUMENTS_TO_DOWNLOAD.md`

**Why Critical:** We need to match the exact format of official templates!

### 2. Validate Schema Against Actual Templates
Once you have the DWSP templates:
1. Compare required fields in template vs. our schema
2. Update schema if any fields missing
3. Ensure JSON structure matches template sections
4. Validate risk matrix format

### 3. Review Regulatory Requirements Document
Read `/docs/regulations/REGULATORY_REQUIREMENTS.md` and verify:
- [ ] All requirements make sense for your use case
- [ ] Nothing critical is missing
- [ ] Understand enforcement procedures
- [ ] Know the deadlines (Nov 15, 2030)

## üí° Key Insights from Regulatory Research

### What We Learned:

1. **DWSP is not one-size-fits-all**
   - Must be "proportionate to scale and complexity"
   - Different templates for different supply sizes
   - Flexibility in format (don't have to use templates)

2. **Progressive Enforcement**
   - Education first
   - Fines range $1k-$500k
   - Focus on biggest risks (protozoa, E. coli)

3. **Multiple Compliance Pathways**
   - DWSP (most flexible)
   - Acceptable Solutions (prescriptive)
   - Different rules for different supply types

4. **Hinek≈çrako Platform**
   - Online submission system
   - Must integrate with it
   - Need to check if API available

5. **24-Hour Incident Reporting**
   - Critical requirement
   - Serious incidents must be reported within 24 hours
   - Need automated notification system

6. **Annual Review Mandatory**
   - DWSP must be reviewed ongoing
   - Amendments as necessary
   - Recommend formal annual review
