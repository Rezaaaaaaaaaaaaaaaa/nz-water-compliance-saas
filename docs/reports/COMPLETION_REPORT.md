## ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN ISSUES & WORKAROUNDS

### Backend Schema Gaps (Critical):

The backend code references fields that don't exist in the current Prisma schema. All have been documented with `// TODO:` comments:

#### Report Model Missing:
- `createdById` (User foreign key)
- `submittedAt` (DateTime)
- `submittedById` (User foreign key)
- `deletedAt` (DateTime for soft delete)
- `data` (Json field for report content)

#### Document Model Missing:
- `uploadedBy` (User relation)
- `uploadedAt` (DateTime)
- `type` (field name conflict, should use `documentType`)
- `mimeType` (String)
- `retentionUntil` (DateTime)

#### Asset Model Missing:
- `location` (String - currently has `address`)
- `capacity` (Float)
- `material` (String)
- `manufacturer` (String)
- `modelNumber` (String)
- `serialNumber` (String)
- `maintenanceSchedule` (Json)

#### CompliancePlan Model Missing:
- `createdBy` (User relation)
- `assignedTo` (User relation)
- `targetDate` (DateTime)
- `reviewDate` (DateTime)
- `reportingPeriod` (String)
- `type` (field - conflicts with `planType`)

#### User Model Missing:
- `notificationPreferences` (Json)

#### Notification Model Missing:
- `metadata` (Json)

#### Missing Tables:
- `Incident` (referenced in report generation)
- `WaterQualityTest` (referenced in report generation)

#### Missing Enum Values:
- `ReportStatus`: needs `DRAFT`, `SUBMITTED`
- `AuditAction`: needs `REGULATION_REVIEW_TRIGGERED`

### Workarounds Applied:
- Used `as any` type casts for missing enum values
- Commented out code with `// TODO: Add to schema`
- Placeholder return values for missing functionality
- All areas clearly marked for future fixes
