## Script Dependencies

### Required

- `bash` - All shell scripts
- `curl` - Health checks and HTTP requests
- `openssl` - Secret generation

### Optional

- `jq` - JSON parsing (improves health checks)
- `aws` - AWS CLI (for AWS deployment)
- `docker` - Container builds (for Docker deployment)

### Installing Dependencies

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install jq
brew install awscli
```

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
apt-get install jq
apt-get install awscli
```

**Windows (WSL):**
```bash
sudo apt-get install jq
sudo apt-get install awscli
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied" error

Make scripts executable:
```bash
chmod +x *.sh
```

### "command not found: jq"

Install jq or the script will fallback to grep-based parsing.

### Health check fails with "Connection refused"

Ensure your services are running:
```bash
# Check if backend is running
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# Check if frontend is running
curl http://localhost:3000
```

1. Run `npm run download-regulations` to check for new documents
2. Review any new or updated documents
3. Assess impact on software features
4. Update compliance requirements database
5. Communicate changes to stakeholders
